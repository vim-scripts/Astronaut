IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT VIM AND GVIM USING THE SAME COLORS, THIS COLORSCHEME IS NOT FOR YOU!!!  (guess I'm tired of those who complain about the use of only 8 colors...)

This colorscheme is a dark-background style colorscheme with the advantage that it works with console/terminal vim in the same way that it works with GUI vim.  Thus it is restricted to using just the basic eight colors that many xterms are limited to.

The <astronaut.vim> file gives you my dark background preferred colorscheme.  If you'd like to see a preview, check out

which has a small picture of yacc code being highlighted by <astronaut.vim>.
          
As of version 2 of the astronaut colorscheme, <astronaut.vim> supports some options which help console vims display properly.  There's a help file (doc/astronaut.txt) which you can enable by typing in a vim
                     
    :helptags ~/.vim/doc/
                         
(correct the path as needed).  The options include:
                                
  let astronaut_bold=1      : use the bold modifier for term, cterm, and gui

  let astronaut_dark=1      : dark colors used (otherwise some terminals
                              make everything bold, which can be all one
                              color)

  let astronaut_underline=1 : assume that underlining works on your terminal
                              Otherwise some groups will have dark-magenta
                              background highlighting.

For example, on my old Sgi workstation, I've found that the Irix o/s needs let astronaut_dark=1 even though its only an 8-color terminal.  Otherwise most everything shows up as yellow.
